Welcome to the Movie Search Website, an interactive platform that helps users explore movies, get detailed cast and rating info, and even chat with a built-in movie assistant. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

***Cinestuff*** is a feature-rich, frontend-driven web application designed to offer users a seamless and engaging experience while exploring the world of cinema. Whether you're a casual movie watcher or a hardcore film buff, this platform helps you discover, filter, and interact with movie content effortlessly.

Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website allows users to:

- Search for movies by title
- Browse films by genre using filters (like Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)
- Check cast information and view ratings
- Add favorites to a watchlist for easy access later
- Chat with a built-in assistant that provides smart responses to movie-related queries like “What’s the rating of Inception?” or “Suggest a good comedy movie.”

The chatbot is designed to mimic conversational flow and enrich user interaction beyond the usual UI elements, making the experience both helpful and fun.
